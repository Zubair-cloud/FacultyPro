# FacultyPro - Offline Attendance Management System

## 📱 What is FacultyPro?

FacultyPro is a smart, offline-first Android application designed specifically for college faculty and teachers. It replaces the traditional pen-and-paper attendance registers with a modern, digital solution that lives right in your pocket.

## 🎯 Why We Made This?

- **No Internet Required:** Colleges often have dead zones. FacultyPro works 100% offline.
- **Save Time:** Taking attendance manually takes 10-15 minutes. With FacultyPro, it takes 10 seconds.
- **Data Ownership:** Your data stays on your device. No cloud servers, no privacy risks.
- **Student Project:** Created with ❤️ by Zubair, for the academic community.
